## Teaching Guide

### Warm Up (10 mins)

**Display:** Display the slide with the following vocabulary and prompt on it:

* **Generative AI** - A type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses patterns from existing content to create new content, such as new text or new images.

**Prompt:** Have you seen AI-generated text before? Or AI-generated images? What's one example you've seen in your life or in the media?

**Discussion Goal:** This is meant to be a low-stakes brainstorm about different ways students have experienced AI-generated content before. Encourage students to share with a neighbor before sharing with the class. Students only need to share a few examples before the lesson can continue. This prompt assumes students are at least aware of AI-generated content - if not, see the teaching tip below for some alternative options.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

**Giving Students Context:** If student responses indicate that some students have never heard of AI generated content before, consider finding a way to show the entire class a demonstration or example of AI generated art. If you decide to follow these options, we highly recommend vetting these examples before showing your class.

* **Option 1 - Demonstration**. You could open an AI Chatbot, such as ChatGPT or Bing AI, and show students how it works and give it some creative and silly prompts. You could also do this with an AI image generator, such as DALL-E or Midjourney. Double-check these links are available through your school's network.
* **Option 2 - A Video.** Consider showing a video of someone using an AI-generation tool, such as ChatGPT or Midjourney. Choose a video where students can still see how the technology works and it's potential.

> Generative AI is a new technology that will have a significant impact on our society. But like all new technology, it has some issues and concerns that people are working on solving. Today - we're going to learn how Generative AI technology works, then learn more about some of the current issues with generative AI and how we can work together to solve them.

**Video:** Show students the [How AI Works: Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-AWdfSFCHQ) video.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> Now that we know a bit more about how this technology works, we can start to think about its impact on society. As we saw towards the end of the video, there are still issues with these models, like misinformation and bias, that teams are working on improving. Let's learn a bit more about some of these issues by taking on different personas of people affected by these issues.

### Activity (30 mins)

#### Collaborative Game (30 mins)

ðŸ“„ **Distribute:** Digitally distribute a Character Card to each student \[from the [Collaborative AI activity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpXZyXyX\_U-L7m7HAP3muIcBRy0zTa2VAGhEedi8XVk/edit) - exact format and delivery method still being determined]. You may decide to distribute these randomly, or pre-select roles for certain students based on their interests, or have students self-select which character they would like.

\[**Dan Formatting Note: Make this a doc with links to each persona. So teacher shares one doc, then students click to view personas with additional info. When they click, doc is able to make a copy? And in teacher resources, google drive folder with each of the files along with PDF / Word versions?]**

**Do This:** Read through the card individually. The card also has a few blank spaces - you can fill these in with additional information about your fake character to make them your own!

At this point, students are only getting familiar with their character - they do not need to start reading the articles on the bottom of the card yet

**Do This:** Read through the articles on the bottom of the card _as if you were this character_. Think about how they would react to what is happening in these articles. Think about how they would feel about what's happening - are there things happening that would benefit them? Or that would concern them? On the second page of the handout, respond to the articles _in character_.

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they read through the articles. As they begin answering questions, remind them that they are acting in-character. You may even encourage them to speak to you as if they were that character, acting out how they feel about these articles.

**Regroup:** Once students have had a chance to reflect in character, regroup the class to continue to the next part of the activity.

ðŸ“„ **Distribute:** Hand out the Collaborative AI Activity to each student.

**Do This:** Read the first page as a class so students understand the instructions. Emphasize that the goals is not to argue or have a debate, but instead to try and work together to find common ground. It's okay to disagree, but students should use that the find common ground that includes all perspectives rather than invalidate or dismiss a point of view.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

**Collaborative Game:** This activity is modeled after Collaborative Board Games, where the team wins by cooperating to overcome a scenario presented by the game (such as a zombie invasion or a haunted house). Students are not playing against each other or "debating" against each other - instead, they must cooperate to come up with a set of guidelines that satisfy their scenarios. That's how they "win the game" in this activity.
{% endhint %}

**Group:** Have students find their group by matching the letter in the corner of their character sheet.

**Do This:** Have students follow the steps and discuss as a group what their recommendations should be, taking into account the different needs of each person.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

**Differentiation Options:** As a way to differentiate _how_ students perform this task, consider two possible adaptations for how students create their recommendations:

* **Create a Comic Strip / Movie Script:** Students can work individually to create an artistic representation of what this discussion would look like as the team comes up with their generative AI recommendations. This still lets students think through the push-and-pull of a collaborative decision, but can be accomplished individually
* **Act out a Skit**: Students work in their group to come up with a skit that acts out the process of coming up with their generative AI recommendations. This still lets students engage in the push-and-pull of a collaborative decision, but ups the ante to a more performative or exaggerated presentation of their solution.
{% endhint %}

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they have their discussions and come up with their recommendations.

**Share Out:** Consider having groups share out, such as doing a gallery walk.

### Wrap Up

**Prompt:** Choose 2-3 prompts below to have students reflect on their experiences:

* What was the biggest challenge you successfully resolved?
* Whose needs were the easiest to meet?
* Which compromise are you proudest of?
* List what you felt were the top concerns/needs that needed to be met.
* What is your biggest concern about generative AI moving forward?
* What is your most exciting hope about generative AI moving forward?
* In a letter, write your advice for businesses and organizations to collaborate on issues of AI. Use what you learned today, and include one article.
