# Generative AI Brainstorm

### Key Resources

* [Generative AI Video](https://youtu.be/X994dDnmRmY)

> _Generative AI is a type of AI that uses patterns from existing content to create new content, such as new text or new images._

* Is this ethics lesson? Or Generative AI lesson?
  * Ethics:&#x20;
    * Images:&#x20;
      * deepfakes; bias in generation;&#x20;
    * ChatGPT:
      * misinformation; parroting views; environmental impact; plagiarism
    * If we do it this way: is it a "buzzkill"
* Can we go down rabbit hole of collaborative stakeholder game
  * Must achieve \[X] in conversation
  * Consensus is the goal
  * Can you make it so all points are represented in final product

### Warm Up

Option 1: Watch the 2 other videos

Option 2: Recall from previous lessons

### Lesson Introduction / Hook

?????

### Areas of Research

* ~~Areas of concern around~~ "Problems we need to solve for" of generative AI. Present as Slide Deck?
  * Students can investigate, with links to different articles to read!
    * Plagiarism
    * Misinformation / Hallucination
    * Ownership / Royalties around art/text
    * Labor practices around AI
    * Bias in results
    * Lack of Creativity

### ~~Reflection Guide~~

* ~~Which topic did you choose?~~
* ~~Write a 1-2 sentence summary of one of the articles you read.~~
* ~~Brainstorm a list of the stakeholders involved in this issue and what their needs are in this situation~~
  * ~~ie: plagiarism - teachers, students, etc~~
* ~~What thoughts do you have to improve this situation for all stakeholders?~~

~~Then share with your group~~

### Collaborative Game

* Pods of 4 people. Each has a role and win condition
  * Groups can be themed around different implementations of Generative AI (text & images)
    * "election theme", "medical theme", "education theme", "art theme"
      * can we base on real-world cases? ie: helpline wants to replace people with chatbots
* Group works together to come up with business plan that satisfies all of the win conditions of the stakeholders
  * Explicitly call out tradeoffs made between stakeholders or positions that couldn't all be satisfied, and imagine what else would need to exist for all to be satisfied.
*

Options for Output

* Collaborative Game / Business Plan: can present in shark-tank style presentation, or at least turn in the business plan
*
* (Dan) Infographic for how to use generative AI responsibly
* (Dan) "Write your legislator" on policy for how AI
* ~~Code of Ethics~~ Generative AI doesn't deal with ethics in the same way general AI does. Generative AI is sub-category of AI; if we have a code of ethics, should apply broadly across AI and to the entire process (not to end result / how its used). If we did: it makes Generative AI have a higher position above other types of AI, which is not true.

  * <mark style="background-color:green;">???</mark>
* Activity
  * (Yim) Research Areas (new format)
  * (Yim) Research Reflection (new questions)
  * <mark style="background-color:green;">(Dan/Yim - low stakes) UNKNOWN: Group share out / get perspective from others</mark>
  * (Dan) Options for student product
    * (Dan) Code of Ethics
      * quote
    * (Dan) Imagine your World + Gallery Walk
      * Include Ruha Benjamin Quote
    * (Dan) Manifesto
    * (Dan) Headline + Article
    * (Dan) Infographic
    * (Dan) "Write your legislator"?
* Wrap Up
  * Ruha Benjamin quote
  * Write about your imagined world with technology

## Meeting 8/30

* Students get into groups
* Read about a generative AI technology
  * ie: deepfakes; misinformation news w/AI; AI art and concerns; actor concerns; etc.
* [**Collaborative Game Activity**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpXZyXyX\_U-L7m7HAP3muIcBRy0zTa2VAGhEedi8XVk/edit)
  * What "lever of influence do you have?"
  * "Collaborate on a series of rules / guidelines / protocol for their organization"
  * But - each person represents a different stakeholder
  * Each person gets a card; get to personalize
    * Some things they can fill in (silly things)
    * Given to them: excited about; worried about
  * Read specific to organizer before group activity
  * Choices for how this is demonstrated
    * Skit / sketch - perform in front of class
    * Discuss in group - done in groups, but present rules to the class
    * Create comic strip / script - done individually, presented individually
* To generate these scenarios, each scenario needs...
  * description of org
  * 4 personas. Ideally...
    * who they are
    * what they want
    * what they're worried about
    * Holistically: something potentially conflicting with another person
  * Ideally: an article that represents this perspective or that someone could read to get more insight into this perspective



#### Topics of Generative AI (10 mins)

ðŸ“„ **Distribute:** Digitally distribute the Topics in Generative AI slide deck. This deck is designed to be viewed digitally so students can follow the links to do more research and skim articles for additional information.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> This technology is still evolving, but right now there are several main topics people are concerned about: misinformation, plagiarism, ownership and copyright, bias in the results, and unfair labor and work conditions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Teaching Tip**

**Customizing the Lesson:** As this technology continues to grow, new issues may arise and existing issues could be solved or become less relevant. As such, feel free to customize the slide deck and this section of the lesson to match the topics that are relevant in today's public discourse. This could include finding new articles for students to explore related to current issues with generative AI.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

âœ… **Do This:** Have students look through the slide deck and read the overview of a topic that interests them, then have them explore at least one article related to that topic.

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they look over the slide deck and an article, but also be mindful of time - this part of the lesson is meant to give a brief overview of the different issues concerning generative AI while a deeper-dive into these issues happens in the next activity. Consider asking students why they gravitated towards a particular slide or what they learned from an article. Take note of which topics certain people or groups are gravitating towards to help decide groups for the next activity.

**Regroup:** Have students regroup so they can share out

**Share Out:** Ask a few students to share a topic they gravitated towards and something they learned about it.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> As we've heard, these topics involve different people with conflicting points of view that can be difficult to untangle. There are people who want to use generative AI to create new works of art, and there are the artists who want to protect their work from being sourced into these programs. There are the people who want to use generative AI to help with research, and then the people who work difficult jobs to help manage the models to make sure they're not producing incorrect or inappropriate content. It can be difficult to find a solution that makes everyone happy, but we're going to try in this next activity.
