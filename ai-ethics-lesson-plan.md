## Warm Up (5 minutes) <a href="#activity-4733790" id="activity-4733790"></a>

**Display:** On a whiteboard, draw a T-chart that says "Helpful" and "Harmful".

**Prompt:** The Internet has been one of the greatest technological innovations in the last century. What are ways it has been helpful towards society? What are ways it has been harmful?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Differentiating the Topic:** You could decide to change this prompt to use a different technology that is more relevant to your students and their interests, as long as there are clear examples of how it has been helpful or harmful in society. For example, you could ask the class for examples of a technology that's had a big impact on their lives and then continue the warm-up using the class idea as the prompt.&#x20;

You could also change the topic entirely to a relevant issue in your community - for example, if a new mining quarry might be opening near a community, this could be used as a topic to discuss ways it can be helpful or harmful (ie: boosts the economy, but may decrease the air quality in the community).
{% endhint %}

Have students brainstorm individually, then share with a neighbor before regrouping. Call on students to share, keeping track of responses on the T-chart.

**Discussion Goal:** Students should be able to pull from news sources or lived experiences to populate the chart. If students struggle generating ideas, continue to the next slide which includes a few examples.

**Display:** Show the slide with various news articles about the impact of the Internet on society. If you changed the prompt to a different technology, also update these slides.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_

> Even though the Internet is a grand technological innovation, its legacy is complicated - in some cases, it's been incredibly helpful and beneficial to society. And in others, it's been harmful and detrimental to society. Technology can have a wide-range of impacts, sometimes beyond what was intended. Today, we're going to example another piece of technology and explore the impacts its having on society: Artificial Intelligence.

## Activity

#### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (5 minutes)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Skip to the Research:** This section starts with a brief introduction of artificial intelligence. If you have already introduced artificial intelligence to students in previous lessons, consider skipping this section
{% endhint %}

**Display:** Show students the definition of artificial intelligence.

* **Artificial Intelligence** - A technology that mimics human intelligence, performing tasks such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

**Prompt:** What are some examples of artificial intelligence you are already familiar with?

**Discussion Goal:** Responses may include examples from movies and television, such as robots like WALL-E or R2D2. They may also include personal examples, like Siri on a phone or TikTok filters that can detect facial features. Try to surface examples that may not be immediately apparent but still govern ways we interact with the world, such as recommendation algorithms on social media, facial recognition, or times when a computer makes a decision.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> Today we're going to explore several specific areas of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to uncover how these technologies have influenced society, both in positive and negative ways. We'll read several recent news articles on these technologies and fill out a reflection sheet, then have an opportunity to decide our own opinions about these technologies as a whole.

#### Student Research & Reflection (15 minutes)

**Groups**: Place students in groups of three or four.

**Distribute:** Digitally share the [AI Research Areas activity guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F7jlc3lw9UQ2ZLO6NDLO5wj543IntOT0fC1fpQwDo3s/edit). This activity guide is designed to be used digitally so students can click the links and explore the online resources.

&#x20;**Do This:** Read over the introduction on the activity guide. Have groups choose an area of specialization, encouraging groups to pick different topics if possible. Students should skim 2-3 articles on their topic.

&#x20;**Distribute:** Provide each student with one copy of the [AI Ethics Research Reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfAtafc2GTtWbLy7HM5NbUNYjoQwavLjTyZoXHdgQvY/edit) handout.

**Do This:** Have students research their area with fellow group members, answering questions on the handout along the way. Have students only consider the front page of the reflection for now. Students can skim the longer articles for key ideas, take notes, pose additional questions, and use a search engine to investigate further if time permits.

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they perform their research. Consider prompting students for their reactions as they read certain articles, especially on unexpected impacts of technology on society.

**Regroup:** Regroup the class for a class shareout

**Prompt:** What is one thing that surprised you in your research? This could be about a positive use of this technology, or something concerning you didn't know about.

**Discussion Goal:** This is an opportunity for students to share their thoughts and reflections from the articles, processing their thoughts and emotions. Some students may have strong reactions to the way AI is being used in society, both positively and negatively. Try to guide the discussion so a variety of perspectives are heard, possibly even complicating people's thoughts on the technology as they weigh the pros and cons of these technologies and whether the benefits are worth the other consequences.

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> Any new technology can be complicated, as we've heard so far. One of the challenges is figuring out how to weigh the benefits with the harms - what potential downsides are we willing to accept in order to reap the benefits of a new technology? Or do we need to make changes so the harms are minimized? Or rethink things entirely?
>
> This line of thinking is related to **ethics**, or guidelines on how a person or society should behave.  After reading the articles, you may have an opinion on what ethical uses of this technology are. We're going to imagine what these ethical uses might be on the back of your activity guide.

**Do This:** Have students flip to the back of their handout and read the introduction.

**Display:** Display the slide with the ethical frameworks on them:

* Utilitarianism - Does this generate the best outcome for the largest number of people?
* Deontology - What are the rules?
* Rights-Based Ethics - Are people's rights being honored?
* Care-Based Ethics - Are people receiving appropriate care for their wellbeing?
* Fairness Approach - What action treats everyone the same?

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> These are examples of **ethical frameworks**, which are different viewpoints on how to make ethical decisions. Take some consider which viewpoint resonates with your own on how to address some of the issues with the technology that you researched

**Do This:** Have students fill in the back of their reflection guide

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they complete the task, connecting their own ideas with different ethical frameworks. The frameworks are meant to help students shape their thoughts and potentially make them more coherent, and introduce them to other viewpoints on how to solve a particular problem. For example, students may default to a Utilitarian point of view where as long as the most people get the benefits everything is fine, but may shift their thinking when considering an Ethics of Care perspective and reconsider how technology impacts different groups.

**Regroup:** Regroup students to introduce the culminating activity of the lesson.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Final Product Options:** Below are several choices for how students synthesize what they've learned in these articles and create an artifact to reflect their learning. We recommend choosing one of the options below and definitely **not** doing all of them. Or, combine or rearrange or reimagine the way you would like students to show their understanding at the end of the lesson.
{% endhint %}

## Option 1: AI Code of Ethics

This section guides students towards creating a class-wide AI Code of Ethics, synthesizing what they've learned from the articles.

&#x20;**Display:** Share an example of an AI code of ethics, such as those by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1%3Aprimaryr6) and [Google](https://ai.google/principles/).

&#x20;**Discuss:** _Your next task is to create a similar resource, an “AI Code of Ethics”. Based on what you’ve read and discussed, what are the most important ethical principles (rules) you believe all current and future AI must follow?_

Have students discuss in their groups to brainstorm some initial ideas before regrouping to give a more specific task

&#x20;**Do This:** Students will write at least one principle for the class code of ethics. Ideally, their principles should be written as a sentence followed by a short paragraph that provides more context to the reader (see Google’s page).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Displaying a Class Code of Ethics:** The format of your class Code of Ethics is completely up to you and your students. For example, you might ask groups to create a poster, or for each take a single slide from a shared presentation (such as the one from our [Our AI Code of Ethics \[Template\]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SJEXpTCKwf5fbDy5GuDjDGAsuUrkI9QfxKF-1pMSndg/edit?usp=sharing)), or a page from a shared document. You might even ask students to use their webcams to record short video clips that you can compile and publish as a single video. Be as creative as you wish!
{% endhint %}

## Option 2: Create a Manifesto <a href="#activity-4733792" id="activity-4733792"></a>

This section guides students towards creating a personal AI Manifesto, synthesizing what they've learned from the articles.

**Display:** Share the slide with the [Holstee Manifesto](https://www.beachtig.com/dl/019096d7d9c066d5d1c53ef5f5e35b7f/The-Holstee-Manifesto.pdf) on it

**Prompt:** This is a document called the Holstee Manifesto. What do you notice about how it's structured? What is one line that stands out to you?

Give students a chance to discuss with partners before regrouping

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> This is an example of a Manifesto - it's a special document created to clearly and concisely describe a set of values or beliefs. Sometimes people create manifestos as a reaction to how they see the world so it inspires change, and sometimes people create them to build community and inspire like-minded individuals. Now that we've read more about the impacts of AI on society, we're going to write our own personal manifestos about AI technologies.

**Distribute:** Pass out a copy of the [Create a Manifesto Activity Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCY1VWUCT3mgXAdQ3KD7C29r8yfNxbz3b3lvu8jibI4/edit). Have students read through the top section while displaying the slides on the board.

**Display:** Display the slides describing the three reasons to create a manifesto, along with the links.

As students finish reading, open up each of the manifestos so students can see what they look like and skim some of the principles. Don't spend time deeply reading each one, but instead let students get a sense of the length of the manifesto, how it's designed visually, and the structure of each of the statements in the manifesto.

**Do This:** Have students create their own personal manifesto centered on AI technology. Encourage them to be creative in how they design their manifesto. You can circulate and prompt students to tell you why they are including certain statements in their manifesto, listening for connections back to the articles from earlier in the class.

**Display the Result:** Consider how you would like to display the manifestos students create. If time permits, allow students to do a Gallery Walk looking at the content created by their peers.&#x20;

## Option 3: Imagine Your World Art Display <a href="#activity-4733792" id="activity-4733792"></a>

This section guides students towards creating an artistic expression displaying an idealized world that uses artificial intelligence. Students also create a smaller artist-card to go along with their artistic work.

**Display:** Show the following quote from Dr. Ruha Benjamin

> "Remember to imagine and craft the worlds you cannot live without, just as you dismantle the ones you cannot live within"

**Prompt:** How do you think this quote could apply to some of the scenarios we've read about today?

Have students reflect on their own and share with a partner before returning as a full group

> :microphone2: _**Remarks**_
>
> This quote invites us to reimagine our circumstances and see the world as we wish it was. Based on the articles we've explored today, we're going to do exactly that - imagine a world where AI technology has been developed and implemented justly - what would that look and sound like? We're going to create a piece of artwork that imagines that world, then we'll hang it up on the walls along with a short artist card describing the world you've imagined.

**Distribute:** Hand out the [AI Ethics - Imagine your World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KfPa5xnZN0pOJtQGm0KU69TAsX37xJgdnnfyU1RPtRI/edit#heading=h.y0bs2we1o77m) activity guide

**Do This:** Read the top two paragraphs and answer any questions about the directions.

Give students directions on how they should complete their artwork, for example:

* Using physical materials, such as drawing paper and paint
* Using three-dimensional materials, such as sculpting with clay or molding with cardboard
* Using a digital representation by designing using digital tools.

You may also decide to give students choice in the materials or format that they use. If teaching this in a single day, consider something on a smaller scale such as just a pencil and paper or a digital photo collage.

**Circulate:** Monitor students as they complete their artwork. Also ensure they are completing the Artist Card to explain the artwork they are creating.

**DIsplay the Results:** Consider how you would like to display the results in your classroom, either physically or digitally. Consider having students take a Gallery Walk to explore the artwork their peers created.

## Wrap Up (5 minutes) <a href="#activity-4733792" id="activity-4733792"></a>

&#x20;**Video:** Watch the video [How AI Works - Privacy and Future of Work](https://youtu.be/zNxw5gJtHLc)

&#x20;**Prompt:** _How would you describe “AI ethics” to a family member or friend who didn’t participate in today’s lesson?_

Encourage students to use evidence from their research in explaining what AI Ethics could be.
